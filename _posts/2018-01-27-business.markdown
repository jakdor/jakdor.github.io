##### We can all agree that retro is back, and stronger than ever before...

###### Back in the late 2016 I was working on a project that was using old nixie tubes to give them life once again with modern electronics and microcontrollers. After my design cough a lot of attention online, it became apparent to me that turning my electronic hobby into business might be easier then I have expected.

###### Since January 2018 I'm officially selling my designs to others interested in retro electronics. With manufacturing in China and world wide shipping on eBay I was able to sell over 400+ units so far, with 100% positive feedback.  

###### status: **3 different designs available for purchase on eBay.com**

##### Update 26.02.2020:

###### I've released all my designs as open source. Links bellow.
