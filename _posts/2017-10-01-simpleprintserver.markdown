##### Cross-platform desktop project for launching print jobs remotely without need to install drivers on client-side

###### This is basically Google Cloud Print clone before it went into public beta. 

###### Main purpose of this project was to create alternative system for LAN/Internet printing, by removing need to install printer drivers on client side. It can be a viable solution when drivers for printers are not available for client OS but working on host/server PC. 

###### Project also aspired to provide stable and reliable data transfer architecture as a alternative to Samba based Windows architecture suffering from connection issues.

###### status: **alpha1.0.2 - MVP Proof of Concept build, project abandoned because Google did it better**
